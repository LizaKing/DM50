There are some diseases that can kill children or cause lasting damage to their health. Sometimes your child's immune system needs help to fight those diseases. Immunisation - also called 'vaccination', 'jabs' or 'injections' - provides that help.
Immunisation prepares our bodies to fight serious infections that we may come in contact with in the future.
Because immunisation is so successful, it is now rare for children to get serious diseases like diphtheria, polio or tetanus. While cases of measles and pertussis (whooping cough) are now also much less common compared to a number of years ago.
However, if children are not immunised against these diseases, they will come back again.
Vaccines are offered to all children to protect them against the following diseases:
 Around 13 months old Measles, mumps and rubella  MMR  
In addition, some babies in high-risk groups are given a BCG immunisation for protection against tuberculosis shortly after they are born. Higher risk infants may also receive immunisation against Hepatitis B.
Your doctor or health visitor will give you more information if your child needs any of these.
All parents receive invitations at the appropriate times to have their child immunised.
Before your child starts school, they will usually get their vaccinations either at your doctor's surgery or local health clinic. An appointment is usually sent from the Child Health System or by your surgery.
Some vaccinations are given in school. The school will contact you before your child is given any immunisation.
If you have any questions, you can talk to your health visitor, doctor, school nurse or practice nurse at your doctor's surgery.
